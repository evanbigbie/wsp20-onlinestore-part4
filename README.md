# Online Store (2020)

This is a web application I built for a web server class in the last semester of my CS Bachelor's program. I will be updating this readme as I get some issues hammered out that resulted from transitioning to a new development environment.

## Dev Setup

```
To run you need to execute the following in the terminal:

1. If setting up for the first time on a machine:
$flutter login
$flutter init

2. Each time running:
$flutter serve

Open browser window and go to url: localhost/5001
```

## Built With

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Language
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) - Framework
